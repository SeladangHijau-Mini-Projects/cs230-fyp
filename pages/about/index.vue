            Data visualization is a way of representing data in a form of
            graphical representation to help the viewer to understand the data
            that is being visualized. Other countries such as United States of
            America, United Kingdom, Australia and India have visualization
            their election result data using map visualization. However, most of
            election data in Malaysia are represented in tabular format and
            non-interactive graphs. This creates a problem for certain viewers
            because they could not understand the context of the data. The aim
            of this project is to represent the election result data in a
            simplified approach using hexagon tile grid map data visualization.
            This project utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript and D3.js library to
            create hexagon tile grid map data visualization that visualizing the
            election data in Malaysia map. The system consists of three level of
            information. The first level shows the hexagon tile grid map of
            Malaysia. The second level contains the gender distribution of the
            state. The third level shows the election result with winning party
            and candidate, besides of ethnic distribution of the selected
            parliament. This project is validated by comparing the output with
            the given input data. This project has successfully visualized the
            election result accurately. This visualization helps to simplify the
            representation of the election data and the viewer can understand
            the data easier.
